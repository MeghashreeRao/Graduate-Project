# Graduate Projects
#### _The list of projects as code and rmd files_

The below describes the set of projects conducted throughout my graduate program in **_Data and Computational Science_** at **UCD**
- **Final_Project** : .rmd file consists of data analysis on OldCar price data set, from Kaggle. Here , the resale car price is predicted using certain car features making it easier for common people to understand the resale value of cars. 
- **Python_project** : .ipynb consists of data analysis in python using various packages like numPy, pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib and others. Different models are compared to get the best model to perform the prediction.
- **Bayesian_hierarchical_model.pdf** : This document contains code and decription to the hierarchical model constructed using Bayesian Analysis methods
- **Milk_spectral_analysis.pdf** : The mid-infrared (MIR) spectra data extracted from milk samples, and their associated protein and technological traits is the data set used. Methods like PCA and PLSR are used to conduct this analysis in predicting the level of the protein Î± s1-casein in a milk sample using MIR spectra and choosing the important variables for the best model
- **Predictive_analysis.pdf** : The aim of this project is to examine that there is substantial evidence that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 can be controlled via appropriate government intervention by modelling the daily number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ireland.
- **Hate_speech_recognition.pdf** : The aim of this project is to implement at least 3 different supervised learning methods to predict the hate-speech class label of a sentence on the basis of the numerical features obtained from a sentence. An appropriate framework was later used to compare and tune the different methods considered for evaluating of its prediction accuracy.
- **project.nb** - Project aims to predict the Boston housing prices in _Mathematica Software_.
